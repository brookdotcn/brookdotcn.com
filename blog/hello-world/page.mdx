Hello, I'm currently in the process of changing the backend of this site toward a 'local first' attitude
where the blogs are stored within the file system of the deployed environment instead of within a database
elsewhere. This is purely to cut unneeded boilerplate code and network requests as, let's be
honest, it's overkill for a simple hobby blog but for further information I'll re-write
a 'first' blog explaining why and how I migrated this over at a later date.

  ```tsx-example.tsx
const main = (): void => {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
  ```rust-example.rs
fn main() -> () {
    println!("Hello, world!");
};
```
</CodeBlock>
