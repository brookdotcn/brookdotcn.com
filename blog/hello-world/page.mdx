Hello! It's very likely you haven't been here before but this site has been my personal blog since early February 2024
where I've just spilled my thoughts or shared some 'cool' code snippets but more so than anything else it's a pet project
on the side that has a very low technical draw but enough room to do some cool things every now and again. Originally, this
blog was built with [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org) along with a 'CMS' also built with `next.js` that allowed for
markdown editing and publishing to a [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com) database that was later migrated to 
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) as Planetscale removed their free tier, meaning this site itself only handled reading the
blog data from the database but even that felt unnecessary so I decided to start storing these blogs locally within the
environment file system and I thought I'd share how I did it as I definitely learned a thing or two.

<br />

## Content

<br />

The core of the site's markdown rendering hasn't changed all that much, it's still utilising the well-known library called
[react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) for highlighting code blocks although the
markdown being transformed into markup has changed; now no longer needing the [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
library as this functionality is covered by [mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) (and more accurately, [next-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx))
allowing me to write `.mdx` files that can contain `jsx` components which will act just as they would within `.tsx` or `.jsx` files. Pure
`javascript` objects can also be exported to be accessed when importing the markdown file through the dot notation like you normally would
which is handy for having a 'meta' object describing each file, which is what I've done for my markdown files. Here's an example:


<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.mdx
export const meta = {
  createdAt: new Date("05/20/24"),
  dirName: "hello-world",
  slug: "hello-world",
  tags: ["next.js", "refactor", "blog", "open-source"],
  title: "Hello, World!",
  description: "How I refactored this blog to prioritise local data & remove all network requests.",
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

> **Note:** one thing I've learned is that there is no `typescript` compilation here, so you cannot attach any types within these files.

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.tsx
import HelloWorld from "@/blog/hello-world/page.mdx";

const { meta } = HelloWorld;
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

It's far easier using `mdx` and writing these pure markdown files in-editor as I don't have to re-invent the wheel of markdown parsing within
my 'CMS' on the backend. The original reason for me trying to avoid pure markdown was the case of needing a bit more interactivity & control
over what my content is, using the react components I can call into these files opens up a lot for me in showcasing random ideas, like the
infamous counter component.

## File System

<br />

So now we know how I'm writing the markdown locally, the focus comes to how I plan on reading & importing these markdown files as well as the
metadata embedded within it. Entirely client-side rendering and just delivering the markdown files to the client to be imported would be simple,
but I don't like simple (apparently) so I wanted to utilise the offerings of `next.js` using `generateStaticParams` and server components. This
proved to be difficult as there were some issues involving a changing path, missing files in the built output and a general misunderstanding of how
`next.js` handles the environment's file system... oh and all of this only occurred in production and worked completely fine locally!

<br />

A common issue was locally, you were able to just use relative, absolute or even the custom `typescript` compiler path short-hand e.g. `@/foo`
but server-side using the `node:fs` API would not work and the folder structure was entirely different as well as the root now being some
`var/task/...` altered path so to counter this, the `process.cwd()` and `path.join()` methods were essential for `next.js` to understand you
wanted to read from the same root as you would locally e.g. `@/foo` could be `path.join(process.cwd() + '/foo')` and that would work just fine.

<br />

Let's get into how I'm currently reading the file system with a server-side focus. Firstly, the folder structure for these markdown files is as
follows `blog/(blog_name)/page.mdx` and the plan was always to just iterate over these folders and read these pages.

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-utils.tsx
export const readBlogDirectories = async (): Promise<string[]> => {
  return await fs.readdir(path.join(process.cwd() + "/blog"));
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-utils.tsx
export const readAllBlogsMetadata = async (): Promise<BlogMetadata[]> => {
  const dirs = await readBlogDirectories();
  const blogFiles = await Promise.all(
    dirs.map(async (dir) => import(`/blog/${dir}/page.mdx`)),
  );

  return blogFiles.map((blog) => ({
    ...blog.meta,
  }));
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

With this, I can read in all of these directory names and import the markdown files to access all the metadata objects I export from each to
populate the card information. There still comes the issue of reading the metadata of a single file but that can also just use this function
to iterate over the array of metadata objects to find by a certain property.

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.tsx
const IndexPage: NextPage = async (): Promise<JSX.Element> => {
  const allBlogs = await readAllBlogsMetadata();

  return (
    {/* ... */}
  );
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

> **Note:** having to read in all of the directories again is sub-optimal but for now with such a little amount of blogs it's negligible.

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.tsx
const findBlogMetadataBySlug = async (slug: string): Promise<BlogMetadata | undefined> => {
  const allBlogsMetadata = await readAllBlogsMetadata();
  return allBlogsMetadata.find((blog) => blog.slug === slug);
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

The metadata of these blogs is now covered but what about the actual markdown content? Encountering some issues with the way certain files
will be excluded from the build output if they're not included within the import tree (makes sense, not complaining) and not having any luck
with the [`next.js` configuration options regarding including directories](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/output) docs
led me to (for now) just creating a mapper that takes in the slug from the url, generated from the metadata, and returns the according `mdx`
component.

<br />

> **Docs:** [During `next build`, `Next.js` will use @vercel/nft to statically analyze `import`, `require`, and `fs` usage to determine all files
> that a page might load.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/output#how-it-works)

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.tsx
import HelloWorld from "@/blog/hello-world/page.mdx";

type MarkdownPage = (props: {
  readonly components?: {} | undefined;
}) => JSX.Element;

const findBlogContentBySlug = (slug: string): MarkdownPage | undefined => {
  const slugToMarkdownContent: Record<string, MarkdownPage> = {
    "hello-world": HelloWorld,
  };

  return slugToMarkdownContent[slug];
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

<CodeBlock>
```tsx-page.tsx
const BlogPage: NextPage<Props> = async ({ params }): Promise<JSX.Element> => {
  const Blog = findBlogContentBySlug(params.blogSlug) || redirect("/");

  return (
    {/* ... */}
  );
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

## Conclusion

<br />

This was a long time coming, the maintenance of keeping the live site and the 'CMS' up-to-date was stopping me from making even small
incremental changes or quick fixes. If I was trying to make the next large scale blogging platform... maybe having one would be appropriate,
but not for a small hobby blog site where I mainly use it to force what I learn to stick in my brain by writing it to digital paper. 

<br />

Learning the details of how `next.js` handles the file system was a challenge I'm glad I faced because based on similar issues reported
on the common sites, it's a well-known pain point with some even completely dismissing the idea of keeping the blogs locally with `next.js`
and instead resorting to dropping the framework or sticking to good ol' fashioned database storage. If any of you are here, you may steal some
of my wacky code [here](https://github.com/brookdotcn/brookdotcn.com) and use it for yourself.

<br />

Thank you for reading, I hope this was somewhat interesting but writing is not my game so if it was... read literature and your life will
change I promise.
